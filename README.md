# Drum Machine

This project is a Drum Machine app inspired by FreeCodeCamp's Drum Machine challenge. It was built using React, focusing on fulfilling specific user stories for functional completeness and user interactivity.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to interact with sound pads that play different drum sounds when clicked or when corresponding keys are pressed. It includes the following features:

- **Interactive Drum Pads**: The user can click on the pads or use keyboard keys to play sounds.
- **Power and Volume Control**: Users can toggle the power and adjust the volume of the sounds.
- **Bank Toggle**: Users can switch between different sets of drum sounds, such as "Smooth Piano Kit" and "Heater Kit".
- **Visual Feedback**: Pads visually indicate when they are pressed, enhancing user interaction.

## Features

- **Click or Keyboard Activation**: Drum pads can be activated by either clicking or pressing the corresponding keys (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C).
- **Power Toggle**: Users can turn the app on/off, which disables sound playback and prevents interaction with the pads when off.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the sound volume using a slider.
- **Bank Toggle**: Switch between different drum sound kits.
- **Visual Feedback**: Pads change visually when pressed, indicating they are active.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework used to build the dynamic and responsive UI.
- **Sass**: Used for styling, providing a modular and maintainable approach to CSS.
- **FreeCodeCamp Drum Sounds**: Audio files for the drum sounds are sourced from FreeCodeCamp's public repository.
